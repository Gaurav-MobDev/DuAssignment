# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.
## Screenshots have been added at root in screenshots folder.
## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, take a clone of the project using command 

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/Gaurav-MobDev/DuAssignment.git'
```
## Step 2: Install the packages
Now install the packages added in package.json file

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn add
```

## Step 3: Install Pods for iOS and sync gradle for android
This will install the packages required for iOS(Pods) and android(SDKs)
```bash
# iOS
cd ios && pod install

# android
./gradlew build
```

## Step 4: Start the Metro server
You will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 5: Start Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the project. Run the following command to start the _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
